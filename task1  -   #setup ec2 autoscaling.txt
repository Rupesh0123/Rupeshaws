task1  :-   #setup ec2 autoscaling to automatically adjust no. of instances based of cpu utilization,
            #configure alarm to trigger scaling action in real time if cpu threshold exceed,
            #monitor auto scaling events and instance in real-time to ensure optimal resources utilization and app.perfo

1=  go to ec2 
2= select autoscaling group
3= name:- asg-grp
4= select launch configuration 
5= name:- LC1
6= copy ami id and paste in search bar also select that ami
7= instance type :- t2.micro
8= security grp:- creat new grp and give name: asg-grp
9= select keypair
10= select create launch configuration
11= now select LC1 in launch config.page
12= next 
13= availability zones :-- select all
14= next 
15= next 
16= group size: desired capacity 3, min 2, max 5
17= next:next:next
 
18= click create autoscaling group 
19= now, select automatic scale grp = automatic scaling
20= click create dynamic scaling policy
21= policy name: simple scaling = name: increase-grp = take action: add = 2 = 300 = create
repeate the process for decrease grp = take action: remove = 1 = 300 = create

22= cloud watch = in alarm = select metric = EC2 = select autoscaling group = type group name in search bar = select cpu utilization = select metric = 
23= condition: lower/equal = 20 next = autoscaling action = select autoscaling grp = take action : select decrease = next = name: final-alarm = next = create.

24= now, take ssh of instance 
25= go to mobaxterm
26= type sudo yum install stress -y 
27= type sudo stress --help
28= copy example line and paste below then edit [stress --cpu 80 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10m &]
29= type uptime untill it hits the cpu utilization to 80 
30= goto instance and you will see as the cpu utilization incress the instances are scaled up.
